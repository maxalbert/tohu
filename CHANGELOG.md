# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Note that while this project aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the future,
at the present stage the API is still in flux and the versioning scheme does not follow semantic versioning religiously.
In particular, the major version is likely to remain at `0.x.x` until the API has sufficiently stabilised.
